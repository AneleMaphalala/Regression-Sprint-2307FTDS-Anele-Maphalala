# Project Title: Modeling Energy Generation Shortfall in Spain

## Introduction
The supply of electricity plays a critical role in the livelihood of citizens in any country. Electricity helps us stay connected, keep warm, and feed our families. Therefore, maintaining and improving the standard of living necessitates investing in electricity infrastructure to keep the lights on. However, recent evidence suggests that reliance on purely non-renewable sources is not sustainable.

The government of Spain is considering an expansion of its investments in renewable energy infrastructure. To support this decision, they require comprehensive information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable and fossil fuel energy generation. As such, the government has been tracking various energy sources available within the country.

This project aims to model the shortfall between the energy generated by fossil fuels and various renewable sources for Spain. The daily shortfall, referred to as the target variable, will be modeled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as pressure, wind speed, humidity, and more.

## Data Description
This dataset contains information about weather conditions in various Spanish cities from 2015 to 2017, along with data on the three-hourly load shortfall for the same period. The three-hourly load shortfall is defined as the difference between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and renewable sources.
